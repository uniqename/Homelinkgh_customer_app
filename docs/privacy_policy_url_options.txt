Steps:
1. Create new repository: homelinkgh-privacy
2. Upload privacy_policy.html as index.html
3. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings
4. Use generated URL in App Store Connect

OPTION 2: EXISTING REPOSITORY

Note: This shows the privacy policy code, but Apple prefers web format

OPTION 3: SIMPLE HOSTING SERVICES
- GitHub.io: https://homelinkgh-privacy.github.io

=== FOR IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION ===

TEMPORARY URL (USE NOW):
https://github.com/uniqename/Homelinkgh_customer_app

This works as a temporary solution since your privacy policy content is in the repository.
You can update to a proper web URL later.

Privacy Policy URL: https://github.com/uniqename/Homelinkgh_customer_app

OR (if you set up GitHub Pages):

=== WEB-FORMATTED PRIVACY POLICY ===

I'll create a proper HTML version of your privacy policy below that you can host.

=== MARKETING URL (ALSO NEEDED) ===

Marketing URL: https://github.com/uniqename/Homelinkgh_customer_app

This can be the same as privacy policy for now, or use:
https://uniqename.github.io/homelinkgh-support (if you created support page)
